# Android Simple Contacts Widget

Yet another Simple Contacts Widget for your home screens.

The widget features a minimalistic Holo theme. 
Widget configuration is done only upon creation, if you need to modify the settings you will need to remove and re-add the widget to your home screen.

I built this widget for myself because I wanted something clean and simple and I did not need plenty of options. 

Tapping on a contact will show the QuickContact badge for that contact.

It's a resizable widget! You can long press it and use the "resize" option to change the size on those launchers which support resizable widgets.
